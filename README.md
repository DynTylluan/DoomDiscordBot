# Doom Discord Bot

Hi there, this is a dumb and unfinished Discord bot that I had last touched the code to on 2020-06-07. The bot was written as a kind of way to spite a person on a Doom server that kept on going on about how the new Doom games were terrible in every way and how that they don't follow the lore of the original series, almost like it mattered.

Regardless, this bot has a few issues that won't be fixed such as line 53 to 58 that, when the trigger of `idquote` is used, it is possible that the bot will post `xxx`. If you want to fix this up, please be my guest, but I won't be bothering myself.
